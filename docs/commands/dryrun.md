# Dry Run Command

The `dryrun` command validates an environment configuration and simulates the
creation process without making any actual changes.

## Usage

```bash
holodeck dryrun -f <environment.yaml>
```

## Flags

- `-f, --envFile <file>`   Path to the environment YAML file (required)

## Examples

holodeck dryrun -f environment.yaml
```

## What Gets Validated

The dry run command checks:

- Configuration file syntax
- Provider credentials
- Resource availability
- Network configuration
- Component compatibility
- Dependencies resolution
